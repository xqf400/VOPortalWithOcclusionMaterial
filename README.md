Very simple AR app in visionOS, that shows portal spaces with an occlusion material.

- Build: Xcode 15 beta 6 (Beta 6 is required for some issues of beta 3-5), macOS 14 beta
- Target: visionOS 1.0 beta (You can run the app with the Vision Pro simulator of Xcode 15.)

*Since this project is based on the beta software, this repository is temporal and will be deleted after a while.*
